#  Retaliate or Carry-on: Reactive AGgression Experiment (RC-RAGE)

This GitHub repository contains a reactive aggression task of the preprint, titled "Characterizing the role of impulsivity in costly, reactive aggression using a novel paradigm" by Meidenbauer K, Choe KW, Bakkour A, & Berman MG (2021; https://psyarxiv.com/kw3by/). For the details of the RC-RAGE, please see our paper.

A working version of the task is available at: https://kywch.github.io/RC-RAGE_jsPsych/rc-rage-demo.html  

You can embed the RC-RAGE in your Qualtrics survey by following this tutorial: https://kywch.github.io/jsPsych-in-Qualtrics/rc-rage/.

**Abstract**
Lack of self-control has been theorized to predict an individualâ€™s likelihood to engage in antisocial behaviors such as impulsive aggression upon provocation, but existing measures have not allowed for the specific examination of costly, reactive aggression. We introduce a novel paradigm, the Retaliate or Carry-on: Reactive AGgression Experiment (RC-RAGE) to fill this methodological gap, and test to what extent dispositional impulsivity, self-control, aggression, and state anger contribute to aggression upon provocation when there is a financial cost involved. We find that costly retaliation is strongly linked to dispositional aggression, the tendency to act impulsively, and angry state affect, but less affected by other forms of self-control (e.g., delay of gratification) or social desirability. This work sheds light on the prominent role of motor impulsivity in predicting reactive aggression that has a tangible financial cost and provides a tool for the future investigation of reactive aggression in an experimental setting.

The RC-RAGE is implemented using javascript and [the jsPsych library](https://www.jspsych.org/).
